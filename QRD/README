This design example implements a QR matrix decomposition using the Modified
Gram-Schmidt (MGS) algorithm. For more details, please see this whitepaper:

https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/wp/wp-01277-advanced-qrd-optimization-with-intel-hls-compiler.pdf

If you are using Linux, you can build the design using the following command: 

    make

If you are using Windows, you can build the design using the following command:

    build.bat

You can adjust the following component parameters in MGS.h before compiling:

- ROWS_COMPONENT: This constant defines the maximal number of rows that the QRD
  component can process. A smaller matrix can also be processed, but there is a
  performance penalty if the input matrix is smaller than the maximal size. For
  example, processing a 4x4 matrix in a 16x16 component will be slower than
  processing a 4x4 matrix in a 4x4 component. You can override this constant at
  the command line by using -DROWS_COMPONENT=<size>. For example: 
  
      i++ <...> -DROWS_COMPONENT=4 (Default 8)

- COLS_COMPONENT: This constant defines the maximal number of columns that the
  QRD component can process. You can override this constant at the command line
  by adding a -DCOLS_COMPONENT=<size> flag For example:
  
      i++ <...> -DCOLS_COMPONENT=4 (Default 8)

- DOUBLE_PRECISION: If DOUBLE_PRECISION is defined, then the component performs
  double-precision floating-point arithmetic instead of single-precision
  arithmetic. If it is not defined (default) then single-precision
  floating-point arithmetic is performed. Double-precision arithemetic consumes
  more area and latency, but it produces more precise results. (Default off)


To change how the component is tested, adjust the following testbench
parameters in the QRD_Testbench.cpp file:

- RANDOM_TEST: If RANDOM_TEST is defined, then the testbench streams a number
  of random matrices into the component. (Default on) 

- NUM_TESTS: This macro specifies how many random matrices the testbench
  streams into the component. (Default 5)

- TEST_ROWS/TEST_COLS: These constants specify the number of rows and columns
  in the randomly generated matrices. You can override the TEST_ROWS and
  TEST_COLS constants from the command line by adding -DTEST_ROWS and
  -DTEST_COLS compiler flags (similarly to ROWS_COMPONENT and COLS_COMPONENT).
  These constants should be less than or equal to ROWS_COMPONENT and
  COLS_COMPONENT, respectively. (Default 8 and 8)

- RANDOM_SEED: This constant specifies the seed value used by srand() in the
  testbench. (Default 1138)

- RANDOM_MIN: This constant specifies the smallest possible value that can
  appear in a randomly generated matrix. (Default -10)

- RANDOM_MAX: This constant specifies the largest possible value that can
  appear in a randomly generated matrix. (Default 10)

- PREDEFINED_TEST: If PREDEFINED_TEST is defined, then the testbench runs
  pre-defined tests that stream matrices with well-known QR factorizations to
  the component. See QRD_Testbench.cpp for more details about these matrices.
  PREDEFINED_TEST may be defined along with RANDOM_TEST to test the component
  with both predefined and randomly generated matrices. (Default on)

- SHOW_MATRICES: If SHOW_MATRICES is defined, then the testbench prints the
  calculated Q and R matrices to stdout. (Default on) 

- EPSILON: This constant defines the acceptable level of error between
  predicted values and calculated values. Smaller values of EPSILON will cause
  tests to be more likely to fail. You can override this constant at the
  command line by adding the -DEPSILON=<value> flag. For example:
  
    i++ <...> -DEPSILON=1e-7 (Default 2.0e-5)

Add your own predefined test to QRD_Testbench.cpp by following the conventions
shown in the QRD_Testbench.cpp file.
